// Provider: the venue-agnostic base class every venue provider (Binance,
// Bybit, OKX) derives from. Owns the io_context, the redundant WebSocket
// sessions (one per connection, each carrying both the depth and fast-BBO
// streams), reconnect-with-backoff, the staleness watchdog and its health
// verdicts (NoteDepthActivity/NoteBboActivity, ClassifyFeed via CheckHealth),
// and RequestResync for a sequence gap. Subclasses supply only venue-specific
// parsing, subscription framing and message routing; everything about
// connection lifecycle, liveness and health lives here once.
